## Root

- [[_schema]] — vault conventions, how to write notes
- [[log]] — append-only ingest / query / lint record
- [[Next Session]] — what to do when picking up work next time

## 10 — Architecture

- [[Stack]] — Next.js 14 + TS 5 + Tailwind 3 + Framer Motion 12
- [[Data Flow]] — mockData → filters → curation → pages → UI
- [[Folder Structure]] — how `/app`, `/components`, `/lib`, `/context` divide
- [[App Router Patterns]] — server-by-default, client islands, `@/` aliases
- [[Dual Feed Systems]] — why `ContentGrid` and `ContentFeed` both exist
- [[Overlay System]] — card click → full-screen overlay, URL sync, type dispatch

## 20 — Domain

- [[Vibe Philosophy]] — the four ideas: two-axis system, genre is a lie, system learns, grading as engagement
- [[Vibe Spectrum]] — 0 glacial → 10 volcán, the core filter axis (mechanics)
- [[Vibe Checks]] — crowd `[min, max]` votes per item, threshold-gated median fall-through
- [[HP Curation System]] — decay-based prominence ranking
- [[Content Types]] — evento, mix, noticia, review, editorial, opinion, articulo, listicle, partner
- [[Partners Isolation]] — why partners never enter the main grid
- [[Editorial Flag]] — the one editor lever (boost spawn HP)
- [[Pinned Hero]] — single slot, portada logic

## 30 — Pages

- [[Home]] — `/` — pinned hero + curated mosaic + category rail + partners + calendar
- [[Agenda]] — `/agenda` — events only, date-forward
- [[Editorial]] — `/editorial` — editorials only
- [[Mixes]] — `/mixes` — mixes only
- [[Noticias]] — `/noticias` — news only
- [[Reviews]] — `/reviews` — reviews only
- [[Articulos]] — `/articulos` — longform features only
- [[Foro]] — `/foro` — imageboard-style discussion catalog (threads + flat replies)
- [[Marketplace Page]] — `/marketplace` — public marketplace catalog; `?partner=<slug>` opens a partner's overlay
- [[Dashboard]] — `/dashboard` — auth-gated insider surface for composing new content (visual prototype)
- [[Dashboard Drafts]] — `/dashboard/drafts` — table view of session items with edit / publish / delete actions
- [[About]] — `/about` — identity surface: what Gradiente is + partner ecosystem
- [[Manifesto]] — `/manifesto` — editorial declaration (placeholder copy until team writes)
- [[Equipo]] — `/equipo` — collaborator list with GH handles + per-person bio placeholders

## 60 — Design

- [[NGE Aesthetic]] — Neon Genesis Evangelion as design language

## 70 — Roadmap

- [[Backend Plan]] — current consolidated plan: Supabase + Vercel + R2 + GH Actions cron, magic-link signup + username/password login, invite-code beta gate, image auto-compression, foro 30-day retention, MWF scraper, SYSTEM UPDATE countdown
- [[Scraper Pipeline]] — RA → review queue → live feed (core ingestion path)
- [[Admin Dashboard]] — role-gated editor UI at `/admin` (real-backend version of [[Dashboard]])
- [[Supabase Migration]] — older, narrower draft superseded by [[Backend Plan]]
- [[CRT Shader Layer]] — full-viewport CRT post-processing; pushes NGE chrome to real terminal feel
- [[CRT Scanline Sweep]] — small targeted variant: sweep across the home grid on category-filter changes
- [[Three.js Islands]] — isolated 3D scenes (vibe sculpture, venue map, ASCII'd) per Canvas
- [[HTML-on-Canvas]] — earlier exploration of canvas rendering approaches and tradeoffs
- [[Gamification]] — HP-as-game mechanic, ideas and risks
- [[Open Questions]] — things nobody has decided yet

## 80 — External

- [[FASCINOMA]] — the festival, role in the site
- [[Club Japan]] — Monterrey 56, Roma Norte venue
- [[Partners Ecosystem]] — labels, venues, promoters, sponsored

## 90 — Decisions

- [[Guides Not Gatekeepers]] — the core editorial thesis; editorial content competes with scraped content in the main grid
- [[Why NGE Aesthetic]] — the founding design call
- [[Size and Position as Only Signals]] — no stars, likes, or counters
- [[No Algorithm]] — editorial curation over engagement metrics
- [[Roles and Ranks]] — three identity axes (creation tier + mod/og flags + auto-rank), !/? reaction palette
- [[Polls As Attachments]] — poll = optional ContentItem attachment, per-type variant resolution, card-as-canvas voting, anonymous-until-vote
- [[Marketplace]] — partner-only commerce, dedicated `/marketplace` route, `partnerId` field + `partnerAdmin` flag, four-step approval flow
- [[Why Next.js App Router]] — server-first, file routing
- [[Contained Single Surface]] — card click → overlay, never a route change
- [[Reader Terminal Layout]] — long-form overlays are reading subsystems, flyer demotes to archival
- [[Publish Confirmation Flow]] — three-state model (draft / pending / published) with mandatory confirmation gate
